## Library for Working with Files During Parsing {docsify-ignore-all}

During parsing, it's often necessary to download HTML pages and work with JSON and CSV files. This library aims to simplify the coding required for such tasks and also provides a range of additional features.

### The library includes three classes for core tasks

1. **Pars** for handling requests and bs4.
2. **JsonManager** for working with JSON.
3. **CsvManager** for working with CSV.

### There are also three utility classes

1. **ProgressBarManager** for creating progress bars.
2. **TimerManager** for tracking the execution time of specific code.
3. **ZipManager** for archiving files and folders.

### Install the library:

```bash
pip install ipars
```

or

```bash
pip3 install ipars
```
