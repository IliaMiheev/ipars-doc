### Library for File Handling During Parsing {docsify-ignore-all}

During parsing, it is often necessary to download HTML pages and work with JSON and CSV files. This library is designed to simplify the coding tasks for such activities and provides a range of additional features.

### The library contains three primary classes

1. **Pars** for handling requests and bs4.
2. **JsonManager** for working with JSON.
3. **CsvManager** for handling CSV files.

### There are also three auxiliary classes

1. **ProgressBarManager** for creating progress bars.
2. **TimerManager** for measuring the execution time of specific code.
3. **ZipManager** for archiving files and folders.

To install the library:

```bash
pip install ipars
```

or

```bash
pip3 install ipars
```
